Dear Katie High,  

This letter serves as my application for the position of Project Manager (Remote) at Chromatic. As a communication consultant to clients in a wide range of industries, I have been optimizing digital content for much of my career (some ink-on-paper, content, too!). I am not a Developer, but I am not afraid of code and have enormous respect for talented Developers. I have managed large and small communication projects, working with clients in many time zones, and recently added formal training in project management to my repertoire. I like the Scrum mindset and completed the PSM I certification yesterday so I could offer proof of that. Chromatic's commitment to open source is particularly attractive to me, as I have always been a proponent of open source and steer people in that direction when I can. You sound like a great crew of people and the fact that you are distributed all over the world--well, the world is at last catching up to that idea. I have worked remotely since the early days. Having a worldwide distributed team lets everyone have a sustainable work life while having something going on at any hour. Yes, please!    

Running my own show as a consultant, I have acquired plenty of experience with making timelines; keeping track of hours and budget, including timesheets when necessary; writing reports; and talking with clients about next steps. I can write and edit project documentation and would happily contribute to document and product QA as a spelling and grammar hawk (English professor!), which I am able to do in a cheerful, pleasant way that harms no one's feelings.

I have worked with adult learners, college students at ages 18 to at least 80, nearly every semester for many years. I know that the best thing I can do is listen, help them figure out what to do next, remove any obstacles, then get out of the way and let them do their thing. I teach writing for the most part, but it's true in any discipline. And here I am congratulating myself that--I think!--this approach was the best possible training for a project manager role. 

As you will see, I am a seasoned professional in other fields, and relatively new to project management. My firm belief is that my skill set would be of great value to Chromatic, given our shared values and my communication and management skills. 

Thank you for taking the time to consider my application--I hope we can discuss it further. I think I would make a great <i>Chromatician</i>!  

Sincerely,  

Gail Dillard
